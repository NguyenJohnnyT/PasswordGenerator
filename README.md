## Usage

By clicking the `Generate Password` button on the page, the user will be prompted by a series of questions.  The user must go through the entire series properly before a password will be generated.  For example, the user cannot proceed if they do not enter a desired character length `not` equal or between 8 to 128 characters.  The user also cannot proceed if they do not select any character criteria.

Once the user successfully answers the prompts, the screen will show a password that complies to their selected criteria.
